# the algorithm starts by building a table of neighbors so that for each vertex, it knows which other vertices it is connected to.
# it then maintains two lists, a list of blacknodes (defined as vertices that have been visited) 
# graynodes = vertices that have been discovered because the algorithm has visited its neighbor
# return that blacknode list
