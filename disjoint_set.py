# disjoint sets 
# the set of sets is stored as an array of integers.
# if at position i the array stores a negative number, this number is interpreted as being the representative element of its own set
# if the number stored at position i is instead a nonnegative number j, it means that it belongs to a set that was joined with the set containing j
